# Optimal closed loop control through DNN

Optimal control problems (OCP) can only, in general, be solved in open loop, i.e. with the control and states
as a function of time.

This project aims to learn a function that maps from the states to the control "optimally" 
trought Deep Neural Network (DNN).

The OCP is solved using PSOPT and the DDN using TensorFlow.
